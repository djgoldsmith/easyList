If the unit wishes to do so, it must take an Initiative test.\n\nIf the test is failed, nothing happens and the models remain locked in the fight. If the test is passed, choose a direction - then roll 3D6. As long as the distance rolled, in inches, is sufficient to allow the entire unit to move over 1"away from all of the enemy units they are engaged in combat with, the unit breaks away from combat and immediately moves a number of inches in the chosen direction equal to the 3D6 result, ignoring the units they were locked in combat with. No Sweeping Advance rolls are made. Enemy units that are no longer locked in combat immediately Consolidate D6".\n\nA Hit & Run move is not slowed by difficult terrain, but treats dangerous terrain normally. It may not be used to move into contact with enemy units, and models instead stop 1" away. If there are units with this rule on both sides who wish to disengage, roll-off to determine who goes first and then alternate disengaging them.
