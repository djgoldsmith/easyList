Independent Character, Mighty heroes go where they are needed&COMMA charging at the forefront of the most vital charges and leading their troops to victory. Independent Characters can join other units. They cannot&COMMA however&COMMA join units that contain vehicles or Monstrous Creatures. They can join other Independent Characters&COMMA though&COMMA to form a powerful multi-character unit!  \\ \textbf{Joining and Leaving a Unit} \\ An Independent Character can begin the game already with a unit&COMMA either by being deployed in unit coherency with it or&COMMA if the unit is in Reserve&COMMA by you informing your opponent of which unit it has joined. In order to join a unit&COMMA an Independent Character simply has to move so that he is within the 2" unit coherency distance of a friendly unit at the end of their Movement phase. If the Independent Character is within 2" of more than one unit at the end of its Movement phase&COMMA the player must declare which unit it is joining. If an Independent Character does not intend to (or cannot) join a unit&COMMA it must (where possible) remain more than 2" away from it at the end of the Movement phase. This is to make clear whether they have joined a unit or not. Note that&COMMA after an Independent Character joins a unit&COMMA that unit can move no further that Movement phase. An Independent Character can leave a unit during the Movement phase by moving out of unit coherency with it. He cannot join or leave during any other phase - once shots are fired or charges are declared&COMMA it is too late to join in or duck out! An Independent Character cannot leave a unit while either he or the unit is in Reserves&COMMA locked in combat&COMMA Falling Back or has Gone to Ground. He cannot join a unit that is in Reserves&COMMA locked in combat or Falling Back. If an Independent Character joins a unit&COMMA and all other models in that unit are killed&COMMA he again becomes a unit of one model at the start of the following phase. While an Independent Character is part of a unit&COMMA he counts as part of the unit for all rules purposes&COMMA though he still follows the rules for characters. \\ \textbf{Look Out&COMMA Sir} \\ Independent Characters pass Look Out&COMMA Sir rolls on a 2+. \textbf{Heroic Morale} A unit that contains one or more Independent Characters does not need a double 1 to Regroup if reduced to below 25% of its starting numbers&COMMA but instead tests as if it had at least 25% remaining. \textbf{Special Rules} \\ When an Independent Character joins a unit&COMMA it might have different special rules from those of the unit. Unless specified in the rule itself (as in the Stubborn special rule)&COMMA the unit's special rules are not conferred upon the Independent Character&COMMA and the Independent Character's special rules are not conferred upon the unit. Special rules that are conferred to the unit only apply for as long as the Independent Character is with them. \textbf{Independent Characters and Infiltrate} An Independent Character without the Infiltrate special rule cannot join a unit of Infiltrators during deployment. \textbf{Independent Characters and Ongoing Effects} \\  Sometimes&COMMA a unit that an Independent Character has joined will be the target of a beneficial or harmful effect&COMMA such as those bestowed by the Blind special rule&COMMA for example. If the character leaves the unit&COMMA both he and the unit continue to be affected by the effect&COMMA so you'll need to mark the character accordingly. For example&COMMA Farseer Mehiledrin and his unit of Eldar Guardians are set ablaze by a weapon with the Soul Blaze special rule. If Mehiledrin leaves the unit&COMMA both he and the Guardians will still be ablaze and the ongoing effects of the Soul Blaze rule must be resolved separately. Conversely&COMMA if an Independent Character joins a unit after that unit has been the target of an ongoing effect (or joins a unit after himself having been the target of an ongoing effect) benefits and penalties from that effect are not shared. For example&COMMA Crimson Fists Tactical Squad Hemanez is suffering the effects of the Blind special rule. If Captain Cruiz joins the unit&COMMA he does not suffer the results of the Blind special rule as he was not there when it happened! 
Infiltrate, (Unverified in 7th)Units that contain at least one model with this special rule are deployed last&COMMA after all other units (friend and foe) have been deployed.

This includes in a building (see page 121)&COMMA as long as the building is more than 12" from any enemy unit. Alternatively&COMMA they can be set up anywhere on the table more than 18" from any enemy  unit&COMMA even in plain sight.&CRLF&CRLFA unit that deploys using these rules cannot charge in the first turn.&CRLF&CRLFHaving Infiltrate also confers the Outflank special rule to units of Infiltrators that are kept in Reserves (see page 40). If a unit with Infiltrate is deployed inside a Dedicated Transport&COMMA they may Infiltrate or Outflank along with their Transport&COMMA but if they do&COMMA they must deploy/move onto the table embarked within it.&CRLF&CRLFAn Independent Character without the Infiltrate special rule cannot join a unit of Infiltrators during deployment.
